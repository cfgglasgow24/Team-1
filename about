Welcome to the interactive DeafBlind Manual Alphabet programme.
This programme uses a built-in screen reader to teach the DeathBlind manual through a quiz style method.  
You will be shown a letter of the alphabet in the middle of the screen and asked to select the correct image from either the left or right of the screen. If selected correctly a correct audio message will be played. If incorrect an audio description of how to correctly perform the action will be played along with the correct image. 
This programme aims to be a simple yet effective way to teach users the DeathBlind language alphabet.
We hope in future to be able to expand from single letters to whole sentences to build from this knowledge. 
This programme offers accessibility features which are user friendly for DeathBlind individuals such as: Text size, Volume controls, Blind user-friendly colour schemes, and Text boldness to cater towards limitations.
