### About ###

Welcome to the interactive DeafBlind Manual Alphabet programme!

This programme uses a built-in screen reader to teach the DeafBlind manual through a quiz-style method. You will be shown a letter of the alphabet in the middle of the screen and asked to select the correct image on either the left or right of the screen. If selected correctly, a correct audio message will be played. If incorrect, an audio description of how to correctly perform the action will be played along with the correct image.

This programme aims to be a simple yet effective way to teach users the DeafBlind language alphabet, and we hope to be able to expand from single letters to whole sentences in the future. This programme offers accessibility features which are user-friendly for DeafBlind individuals such as: Text size, Volume controls, Blind user-friendly colour schemes, and Text boldness to cater towards limitations.
